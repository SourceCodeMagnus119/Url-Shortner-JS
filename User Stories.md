1. User Interface (UI)
Input Form: A simple form where users can enter a long URL they want to shorten.
Display Shortened URL: Once a URL is shortened, display the new short URL to the user.

2. Backend Logic
Receive URL: Accept the long URL submitted by the user.
Generate Short URL: Create a unique short URL corresponding to the long URL.
Store Mapping: Save the mapping between the short URL and the long URL in a database.
Redirect: When someone visits the short URL, redirect them to the original long URL.

3. Database Design
Table Schema:
id: Unique identifier (could be an auto-incrementing integer).
long_url: The original long URL.
short_url: The generated short URL.

4. Short URL Generation
Hashing/Encoding: Generate a unique identifier for each URL, often by hashing the long URL or using an incremental ID that is then encoded (e.g., in base62).
Uniqueness: Ensure the generated short URL is unique by checking the database for existing entries.

5. Redirect Logic
Lookup: When a short URL is accessed, look up the original long URL in the database.
Redirect: Send an HTTP redirect response to the long URL.
Example Workflow
User submits a long URL:

User enters https://www.example.com/some/long/path into the form and submits it.
Backend processes the request:

Generate a unique short URL identifier, for example, abc123.
Store the mapping abc123 -> https://www.example.com/some/long/path in the database.
Provide the short URL to the user:

Display http://short.url/abc123 to the user.
User accesses the short URL:

When someone visits http://short.url/abc123, look up abc123 in the database.
Find the corresponding long URL https://www.example.com/some/long/path.
Redirect the user to https://www.example.com/some/long/path.

================================ RESEARCH ===================================
- Make Urls Shorter with a click.
- Generete a Unigue short url identifier and Display it to user.
- After shortening process redirect to main url page ( with the Shortened URL ).
- When someone visits http://short.url/abc123, look up abc123 in the database. Find the corresponding long URL.

================================= OVERVIEW ==================================
- This is a simple url shortner. I hope you already know the logic of such an application.

=============================== DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE =======================
1. Acuire necessary project dependancies and frameworks.
2. Start frontend development.
3. Make proper backend reguest from the frontend to the backend.
4. Write application logic.
5. Integration with frontend.
6. Testing and Debugging.
7. DEPLOYMENT.

=============================== DISCLAIMER ==================================
This setup provides a basic URL shortener. For a production environment, consider using a database like MongoDB or MySQL, adding validation, error handling, and improving security measures.
